# DEX
A Basic Decentralized Exchange contract written in solidity deployed on the Ropstein testnet.
EthDEX is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to buy and sell ERC20 tokens directly with one another, without the need for a central authority or intermediaries.
A decentralized exchange, or DEX, is a platform that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies or other assets without the need for a centralized authority. DEXs use smart contracts to facilitate peer-to-peer trading and are typically deployed on a blockchain.
DEXs solve several problems that are associated with centralized exchanges, including:

Lack of control: When users trade on centralized exchanges, they must trust the exchange to hold and manage their assets securely. This can be risky, as centralized exchanges are often targets for hackers and other malicious actors. DEXs, on the other hand, allow users to retain control of their assets and manage their own security.

Single point of failure: Centralized exchanges are vulnerable to failures or outages that can disrupt trading and prevent users from accessing their assets. DEXs, on the other hand, are decentralized and distributed across multiple nodes on a blockchain, making them resistant to outages and other failures.

Inability to access assets: Some centralized exchanges have been known to freeze or seize users' assets for various reasons, such as regulatory compliance or internal policy. This can be frustrating for users who may not be able to access their assets when they need them. DEXs, on the other hand, allow users to retain control of their assets and access them at any time.

Limited trading options: Centralized exchanges often have limited trading options, such as a limited selection of tradable assets or restrictive trading rules. DEXs, on the other hand, are typically more flexible and allow users to trade a wider variety of assets and use more advanced trading strategies.
